    <h1>Site Purpose Statement</h1>
    <p>The weather affects everyone's daily lives. People who leave their homes want to know how to be dressed, driving conditions, and all kinds of other important information that influences decisions we make every day. That's why we want to provide a weather site that showcases the vital information we all need to go about our lives in the most efficient way. No longer will you need to spend time looking for daily weather conditions -- it will be at your fingertips. </p>
