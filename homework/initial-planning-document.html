    <h1>Initial Planning Document</h1>
        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
    <p>The weather affects everyone's daily lives. People who leave their homes want to know how to be dressed, driving conditions, and all kinds of other important information that influences decisions we make every day. That's why we want to provide a weather site that showcases the vital information we all need to go about our lives in the most efficient way. No longer will you need to spend time looking for daily weather conditions -- it will be at your fingertips. </p>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>People of all different walks of life need weather information. First of all, since we are building a weather app, our audience will include people who have smartphones. Smartphone users are generally using an utility app like this when they are on the go. I think people who use a weather app on their smartphone can be anywhere from high school age to elderly. This includes students who are in their late teens to early adulthood years when they are busy going to classes or working jobs. Then we have people who are in their middle ages where they most likely have children and jobs. And finally, some elderly people will be using a weather app for similar reasons to any other age - to tailor their day around the weather.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience Persona</h3>
        <p>I think I have narrowed my audience down to about three groups that I think will make up almost all of the people that will be using my weather app.</p>
